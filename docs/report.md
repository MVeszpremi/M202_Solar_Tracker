# Abstract

The proposed project aims to improve solar panel efficiency and longevity by implementing a novel dual-axis, image-based sun tracking system. A mechanical gimal is utilized to dynamically adjust solar panels' orientation, optimizing the angle of incoming solar radiation. The core innovation is the use of an  upward-facing camera for continuous sky condition monitoring, enabling precise alignment with the sun and vertical repositioning during extreme weather to minimize wear.

Our apporach improved on the traditional solar tracking methods that suffer from energy inefficiencies due to constant rotational adjustments and the use of outdated analog sensors for weather prediction. This project addresses these shortcomings by employing advanced computer vision algorithms for accurate sun positioning and cloud detection, drastically improving energy capture efficiency and operational effectiveness.

Success metrics include image-based tracking accuracy, angular error rate, response time, efficiency gains, algorithm optimization, environmental robustness, system reliability, and code stability. The project plan encompasses objective definition, design and engineering, prototyping, algorithm development, software creation, testing, and documentation.
